# Sometimes things explode and that's a good thing!
This Monday, my co-founder, ex-girlfriend, and for a long time closest friend, quit. Over one phone call I lost three separate parts of my life and I was devastated.
For a while. My initial emotion was one of relief, followed by hopelessness. How would I replace her and her skills?

I took a day to reflect, not on purpose, but there was a day where I did very little at all. I am fortunate enough to be surrounded by a cohort of early-stage founders, many of whom have already cried the same tears and had the same sleepless nights and are living proof that the tunnel has another side.
Thanks to them listening actively and prompting, I realised that I am stronger now that I had been before, that what I had seen as the pillar of our enterprise was in reality a smothering blanket.
In struggling to lead a company part-time, my co-founder had in effect been holding it back.
We found the same question rising up time and again: how can you keep up with the pace of the company?

The answer? You can't. You can't be everywhere, know everything, do everything. She couldn't and I can't. She knew this, but couldn't see herself living it.
Neither did I. When you are trying to push the bounds of what you're capable, living more and more each day in a place you wouldn't have dreamed of when you were your lesser, past self, it's easy to push too hard, to slip into control mode.
I was put in the position of governor valve to her steam engine, but I jammed closed.

When the boiler exploded on Monday I truly felt that all the pressure released. Once the shock waves dissapated, I was lighter for their passing.
The road ahead is long and uncertain, but a small team you can depend on is better by far than one you can't.
To paraphrase a proverb: 'Alone a youth runs fast, with an elder slow but far, with quarelling donkeys he goes home'.
In closing: when the going gets tough the weak get gone.
