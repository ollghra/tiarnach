Lessons learned from Khabib

Wahed podcast
> You know, it was like I was doing same thing all my life: stability. If you don't have stability, if you don't recover between the trainings, you're never going to become success on...I talk about mixed martial arts, you know.
> You have to train every day, you have to do same thing \[here he enumerates with his fingers\]: sparring, grappling, wrestling, running, like mitts, bag every single day. Lik if you are fighter you cannot sing and come to  inside the cage and win. No you have to do same thing every single day and so many years, so many years, so many years you know. You have to sacrifice everything what you have and a lot of people I know, a lot of athletes, they become boring because they need something new but when you little bit move from your way, you gonna lose because you have to be on one way, every single time, same thing exactly.

> Guys ask me like oh how you become good grappler, good top control, wrestling condition. I was wrestling every day
> like one hour. Non stop. One hour. Can you imagine? With new new new opponents one hour and then when you finish you go do some exercise---lifting, running---and work with coach.
